### Project Description
A seemingly innocuous compress PDF tool.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever wanted to compress a PDF and get a different PDF as the output? We've got you covered!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We take the contents of your precious PDF file that you need to compress and turn the text into a whole bunch of mumbo-jumbo, where you can control the degree of mumbo-jumbo. And we give it to you back, compressed (because it only has the text. Sorry Adobe, we strongly dislike working with PDFs), because we're not that evil :)

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Flask
- Python
- `google-generativeai` for LLM support

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` once you clone the repository to install Flask and `python-dotenv`. Additionally, run `npm i pdfjs-dist pdf-lib` for the other dependencies. 

# Run
```python
python app.py
```
